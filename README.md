Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
Before starting, please read the AirBnB concept page.

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
\description of the command interpreter:
how to start it
how to use it
examples
1. command line interprter, mean shell or command line interface. in allows user to interact with a computer by entering commands the command line interreter then interpret this command and execute the coresonding command.
2. in windows we start it by pressing "window key + R" and then time cmd(command prompt) and then press enter
while in linux we use Crt+Alt+T then enter, whereas in mac we use the Cmd +Space
3. how to use command line interpreter
to naviage to directory we use "cd" followd by the name of directory we wwant to open examle "cd alx+software enginnering".to write file we
either vi, nano, or vim examle"vi airbon. vim airborn, and nano airborn"
examples 
to enbter a directory and list its content
cd Documents
ls
file operation
cp file.txt backup/
mv document.txt new_location/

help cd                  # Displays help for the 'cd' command (Windows)
man ls                   # Displays the manual for the 'ls' command (Linux/macOS)
